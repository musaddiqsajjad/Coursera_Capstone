The Battle of the Neighborhoods

Coursera Capstone Project Report

By Muhammad Musaddiq Sajjad


Introduction
I live in the charming city of Al-Khobar, situated near the sea in the beautiful country of Saudi Arabia. It is one of the twin cities of Al-Khobar and Dammam, that reside side-by-side and have a lot in common.
For this report, I will be focusing on developing a system to recommend locations for businesses of different categories to open in one of these two cities. Any business that is entering the market can make use of this data to determine likely opening locations.
We aim to provide an idea of which district, location and cluster (from K-means clustering) the business should consider opening in.


Data
The data will be sourced from the Foursquare API, which will return location data and nearby venues, along with the venue category. This will help us in categorizing the different kinds of businesses to build our models.
Furthermore, we will be using publicly available district boundaries data and parsing that into a GeoJSON to establish our district boundaries.
